# Did America Really Show Marvellous Economic Performance?

In April 2023, The Economist published an article claiming that
"[Americaâ€™s economic outperformance is a marvel to behold](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/04/13/from-strength-to-strength)".

I loved their visual analysis, but I was surprized by their conclusion. A lot of people believe that America's economic performance is far from being a "marvel".

I repeat and find similar results, but reach a difference conclusion: America has lost its competitiveness, and its performance between 1991-2019 has been only average.
Here is my [Jupyter notebook](Analysis.ipynb), feel free to run and tweak yourself.

## My Analysis

I run the analysis from 1991 (the end of the Soviet Era) and to 2019 (the beginning of COIVD-19). I use constant dollars, rather than current dollar to measure GDP per capita. I also adjust the scale to show economic performance in relation to others.

In this graph, the height of the bars show GDP per capita - a measure of how much wealth is generated every year per individual. The width of the bars show the population, so the total area of the bar shows how much total wealth is generated in the country.

My conclusion is that America kept its place as the wealthy country, but the real growth story came from China. This is a story of convergence.

## Extending the Approach

I thought that the visual was a great way to compare the before and now of economies and populations. So I also included India, Russia and Turkiye.

My conclusion is nuanced: the era beginning in 1991 and ending in 2019 was an era of convergence. However, it was India, China and Turkiye that got the most from this
convergence - among the countries. However, Japan and Russia fell backwards - relatively speaking - and America and Western Europe simply managed to keep their place.
