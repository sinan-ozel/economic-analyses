# Did America Really Show Marvellous Economic Performance?

In April 2023, The Economist published an article claiming that
"[Americaâ€™s economic outperformance is a marvel to behold](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/04/13/from-strength-to-strength)".
I found that surprising, since by conventional wisdom the big economic success story has been China for the last few decades. I felt the need to replicate their analysis.
I got similar results, but I reach a different conclusion. Here is my [Jupyter notebook](Analysis.ipynb), feel free to run and tweak yourself.

The article includes an excellent visual for comparing economic size. My replication is below, keep reading for an explanation!
